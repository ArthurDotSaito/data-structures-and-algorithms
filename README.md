<h1 align="center">Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

This repository serves as my space for catalog some of my learnings in data structures and algorithms. the majority of the codebase is/will be composed in C or C++, however I expect build the same solutions with different languages at some point.

# Requisites

As most of the codebase is written in C, is nice to have a compiler such as GCC.

# Data Structures

  - Simple Linked Lists
  - Double Linked Lists
