<h1 align="center">Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

This repository serves as my space for catalog some of my learnings in data structures and algorithms. the majority of the codebase is/will be composed in C or C++, however I expect build Java and/or Javascript solutions in some moment.

# Requisites

As most of the codebase is written in C, is nice to have a compiler such as GCC.

# Data Structures
