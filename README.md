<h1 align="center">Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

This repository serves as my space for catalog some of my learnings in data structures and algorithms. the majority of the codebase is/will be composed in C or C++, however I expect build the same solutions with different languages at some point. Sometimes the REAMDE's files will be written in english and sometimes in portuguese. I also expect to include the english version for all these files.

# Requisites

As most of the codebase is written in C, is nice to have a compiler such as GCC.

For linux Ubuntu distro, you can use

```
  sudo apt install gcc
```

For Java, it's necessary the Java SDK (Do not forget to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable).

```
  sudo apt install default-jdk
```

C# .NET projects requires the ASP .NET SDK and runtime: [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-2204)
